Thank you to Michaelo (Michael O'Toole) of integramod.com and phpbbireland.com for his tireless work building our portal, many mods and helping create the original install procedure.
A huge thank you to Dion of Dion Designs for his work with phpBB3.0.x. After updating the code to run on php7.X I found his code while researching a solution to abbc3. 
His fixes solved maany problems and pushed us to php8.3 You'll find links to his site in the 'Mods Database' link in the footer as well as credits for most of the mods.
