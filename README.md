IntegraMOD3
===========
Thank you to Michaelo (Michael O'Toole) of integramod.com and phpbbireland.com for his tireless work building our portal, many mods and helping create the original install procedure.
A huge thank you to Dion of Dion Designs for his work with phpBB3.0.x. After updating the code to run on php7.X I found his code while researching a solution to abbc3. 
His fixes solved maany problems and pused us to php8.0 You'll find links to his site in the 'Mods Database' link in the footer as well as credits for most of the mods.
Without Mike, there would be no IM3. Without Dion I would have simply updated integramod.com and called it a day.

Currently all mods install correctly except the Social Network ACP modules. Im still woking on a proper solution. 
For now, after the initial installation is complete, browse to your IM3 installation and first uninstall the social network mod and when complete, re-install the Social Networking mod.
Now it is installed fully and correctly. 
Here is the url to access the install/un-install procedure.
