Please note that as of 09/2025 all back links and public facing copyright credits to phpBB.com have been removed.
The official phpBB staff have made it clear that this version is EOL for them and they do not offer support as of 11/01/2015.
All internal copyrights remain relativly unchanged as we do not wish to minimize the massive effort they expended to build and support the 3.0.x branch or take credit for their work
