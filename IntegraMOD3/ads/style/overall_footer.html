		*addendum  IntegraMOD is built on phpBB3.0.x. 
		Copyright notice and back links removed by Helter (IntegraMOD / Stargate / phpBB2x)
		Reason: phpBB 3.0 officially became abandonware in November 2015, when it reached End of Life status 
		according to the phpBB team's release and support plan. phpBB Group has formally abandoned support 
		for 3.0.x and actively discourages discussion of legacy versions.
		This fork is maintained independently under GPLv2, with full respect for original licensing terms.
		Branding and backlinks have been removed to prevent confusion and to reflect current stewardship.
		All modifications are documented and preserved in accordance with legacy integrity standards.
